I still can't believe I am into fishing now. At first, I just want to find something to do with my dad when he visited us. Now it is also the outdoor activity my son loves. I don't have boat (yet), so I am just doing bank fishing. Anyway, here are some pictures:


<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/bass.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/crappie.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Maybe I should get a bass pro hat...
</div>
