It's very emotional but I am not gonna describe my feelings here.

1. There are many talks about DNA-protein interaction and binding affinity, but what is RNA's role in the whole process? Is it possible that RNA could bind to DNA and affect the TF-DNA binding? Or maybe the RNA-DNA double strand itself is a unique feature that will activate/repress some downstream TF-DNA binding? If lncRNA has function, is that it? You can't "reveal" their function by KO, since it is not strictly cis or trans. Xist's mechanism is similar but its repressive and on the bigger scale. 

ps: yes, I am also thinking about the R-loop paper. 

2. The function of ADAR and Mda5 is intriguing, I should read the Mda5 KO rescue ADAR KO paper again.
