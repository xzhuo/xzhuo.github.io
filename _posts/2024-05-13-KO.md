A knock-out and rescue experiment is considered the "gold standard" to connect a genotype with a phenotype. You knock a gene out, some feature's gone; then reintroduce the gene product, boom, the feature's back.

I have nothing against KO-rescue experiments, but given the complexity of gene expression regulation we still need to be causious intepreting results from these experiments.
